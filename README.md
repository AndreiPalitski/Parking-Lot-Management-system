# Parking Lot Management System

## Overview
This is a simple Python-based Parking Lot Management System that allows users to:
- Add cars to the parking lot
- Remove cars from the parking lot
- Check parking prices
- Administrator parking settings (price per hour, capacity, clear parking lot, etc.)
- Save parking data to a CSV file
- Calculate parking fees based on time parked

## Features

- **Pricing System:** Set and update parking prices per hour.
- **Admin Panel:** Change lot capacity, clear parking data, and view statistics.
- **Time-Based Billing:** Calculates total hours parked and corresponding fee.
- **Persistent Storage:** Saves parking data in a CSV file.
